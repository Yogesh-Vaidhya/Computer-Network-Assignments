Steps:
1. Unzip the file.
2. All the file should be in one folder
3. Code is written in python 3

4. To run the code in cmd or terminal type command:
   python3 main.py

5. input.txt file contain the information of the topology of the network.
    For simplicity,
    node 'a' is numbered as 0
    node 'b' is numbered as 1
    node 'c' is numbered as 2
    node 'd' is numbered as 3
    node 'e' is numbered as 4

    Input format:
    5               <-- No. of nodes or routers
    0 1 16 16 1     <-- Adjacency Matrix for nodes 0 to 4 ie. 'a' to 'e', 16 --> signifies that link is not present and cost is infinite,  
    1 0 1 16 16                                                           1 --> signifies link is present and cost is 1,
    16 1 0 1 16                                                           0 --> signifies link is present and cost is 0,
    16 16 1 0 1
    1 16 16 1 0
    1 2             <-- Link which is broken between 1 and 2

6. Also for verifing the answer from cmd or terminal, output.txt file has final code output which I have got.

7. In the output:
   -1 : in next_hop(in routing table) means: No next hop present
   16 : in distance(in routing table) means: Unreachable
